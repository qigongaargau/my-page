# Qigong Aargau – Website ([)](https://qigong-aargau.org/)

Static website (plain HTML/CSS/minimal JS) for a Qigong practice in Canton Aargau.
Hosted on **Cloudflare Pages** (free tier), deployed automatically from this **private GitHub repo**.
No framework, no build step. A dynamic backend can be added later via **Pages Functions** without changing hosting or workflow.

Everything at the repo root is deployed as-is. Shared header/footer are duplicated
across the 6 pages — acceptable at this size; revisit only if the page count grows.

## Local development

No toolchain required. Edit files, then either open them directly in a browser or
serve locally (needed for correct relative paths / redirects testing):

```bash
git clone git@github.com:qigongaargau/my-page.git
cd my-page
python -m http.server 8000     # http://localhost:8000
```

## Publishing flow (how a change goes live)

```
edit → commit → push origin main → Cloudflare Pages webhook fires
     → Pages clones repo → no build (direct upload) → deploys to <project>.pages.dev
     → custom domain serves the new version, cache invalidated automatically
```

Step by step:

1. **Edit** locally, on a branch or directly on `main`.
2. **Commit & push** to GitHub.
3. **Cloudflare Pages** is connected to the repo via the Cloudflare GitHub App
   (installed once, scoped to this repo only). Every push triggers a deployment:
   - Push to **`main`** → **Production** → live on the custom domain.
   - Push to **any other branch / PR** → **Preview** → unique URL
     `https://<hash>.<project>.pages.dev`, shown in the PR checks.
     Use previews to show the owner changes before going live.
4. **Build settings** (Pages → Settings → Builds):
   build command *(empty)*, output directory `/`. Pages uploads the files verbatim.
5. **Deploy time**: typically < 1 min. Status in Cloudflare dashboard
   → *Workers & Pages* → project → *Deployments*, and as a GitHub commit check.
6. **Rollback**: Deployments list → pick any earlier production deployment
   → *Rollback*. Instant, no rebuild — every deployment is kept immutable.

No CI configuration, tokens, or secrets in the repo — the GitHub App handles auth.

### One-time setup

1. Cloudflare dashboard → *Workers & Pages* → *Create* → *Pages* → *Connect to Git*.
2. Authorize the Cloudflare GitHub App **from the dedicated GitHub account**,
   grant access to this repo only.
3. Leave build command empty, output dir `/` → *Save and Deploy*
   → first deploy on `<project>.pages.dev`.
4. **Custom domain**: Pages project → *Custom domains* → add
   `qigong-aargau.org` and `www.qigong-aargau.org`.
   With the zone already on Cloudflare nameservers, CNAMEs are created automatically;
   SSL certificate issues within minutes.
5. `www` → apex redirect via `_redirects`:

   ```
   https://www.qigong-aargau.org/* https://qigong-aargau.org/:splat 301
   ```

## Preview password (pre-launch)

Until go-live the whole site is protected by HTTP Basic Auth via
`functions/_middleware.js`:

1. Cloudflare Pages → project → *Settings* → *Environment variables*
   → add `SITE_PASSWORD` (Production **and** Preview), value = shared review password.
2. Redeploy (env var changes apply to the next deployment).
3. Visiting any page now prompts for a login — any username, the shared password.
4. **Go-live**: delete the `SITE_PASSWORD` variable and redeploy. The middleware
   then passes every request through unchanged; it can stay in the repo.

The password lives only in Cloudflare, never in the repo.

## Future: dynamic backend

When dynamic features are needed (contact form handling, course registration,
booking), the path is **Cloudflare Pages Functions** — serverless endpoints that
live in this same repo and deploy through the same push-to-`main` flow:

```
/functions
└── api/
    └── contact.js       # served at /api/contact
```

- File-based routing: `functions/api/contact.js` → `POST /api/contact`.
- Free tier: 100k requests/day — far beyond this site's needs.
- Secrets (e.g. an e-mail API key) go in Pages → Settings → *Environment variables*,
  never in the repo.
- For state (registrations, bookings): Cloudflare **D1** (SQLite) or **KV**,
  both bindable to Pages Functions on the free tier.
- Add **Turnstile** (Cloudflare's captcha, free) to any public form for spam protection.

Nothing about hosting, DNS, or the publishing flow changes — the static pages and
the functions deploy together, atomically, per commit.

Until then, contact is a `mailto:` link or plain listed phone/e-mail.

## Legal (Swiss)

- **Impressum**: required — name, address, contact of the site operator.
- **Datenschutzerklärung**: required under revDSG (in force since 1 Sep 2023);
  must cover hosting (Cloudflare, US provider → mention SCCs), contact data
  handling, and any embedded third-party services (self-host fonts; avoid
  Google Fonts CDN and embedded maps, or disclose them).
- No cookies/analytics planned → no consent banner needed. If analytics are
  wanted later, use Cloudflare Web Analytics (cookieless, free).
